> It's THE Wall-E with a Gearbox attached. This is the new standard in Wall-E racing! It can turn each wheel independently of one another! Wow! The future is here! <sup>(Maybe now it can catch up to EVA, because gearboxes make everything faster)</sup>

This was a class project that was done in Solidworks. Our team took a model of Wall-E from grabcad and recreated it. I spent most of my time on the main body which involved mirrors, lofts, sweeps, and making sure the features didn't break with surface contact issues. We had difficulty with the animation since there were so many DOF and the computers were on a virtual machine. All in all, I really enjoyed this project.
